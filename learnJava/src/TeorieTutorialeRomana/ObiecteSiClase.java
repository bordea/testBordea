Object creation
The object are created by making an instance of a class. Creating an object means declaring it, instantiating it and initializing it
1. Declaring the pbject --> ClassName objectName
2. Instantiating the object using the operator new. This physically creates the object with the space allocation required
3. Initializing --> it's realised through the classes's constructors. The initialization can be done with or without parameters.
        The only condition is that there must be a constructor with those parameters
All these 3 steps can be done on one line as follows
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(param1,param2);
