Programs often need to read information from an external source or send information towards an external source. The information can be
found in a file on a disk, on the network, in memory or in another program of any type: primitive data, objects, images, sounds, etc
So that a Java program can bring information from 'outside' it must open a channel of communication, a stream. towards the information
source(file, memory, socket, etc) and then it'll read serially the information.
The same way works when it sends information towards an external destination source(stream) it'll write the information serially
