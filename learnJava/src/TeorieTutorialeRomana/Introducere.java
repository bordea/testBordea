/*The source file is saved in a file with exension .java
The file that contains the source code of the class must have the same name as the primary class of the application(the class
 with the main method).
At the compilation the apeal is made for the file that contains the main class. A separate file is created by the compiler
 for each class. The extension for these will be .class and they will be placed in the same directory with the main source.
To run this manually we can run the command "java AppName" (note that the .class extension is left out) */
