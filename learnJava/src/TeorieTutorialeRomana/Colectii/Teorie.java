A collection is an object that puts together more elements into a single unity. This way we'll have access to types, arrays,
 tables, etc. The collection are used for the easier storage and usage of data and also for trasmitting the data easier from one
 method to another.

When we think at collection we think at the following 3 concepts:
- Interfaces --> abstract data types that describe the collections. These interfaces allow the use of collections independently from
 the interface.
- Implementations --> the concrete implementations of the interfaces describe the collections. These classes will represent reusable
data types.
- The algorithm --> the methods that run various useful perations like searching, sorting for the objects that implement the
 interfaces that describe the collection. These algorithms are also called porlymorfics because the same method can be used
 in different implementations of a collection. We see this way the obvious reusability function.

Advantages, when using collections:
- the developer has access to a set of data types and algorithms that help with structures and operations used in applications
    more often so there could be a lot of time saved
- The effective implementation of collection will shorten the runtime of the program and will also improve its quality. This way we
 could pay less attention at the way we represent and work with the info and just get on with the solution
